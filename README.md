## Info:
This repo is created to show **the progress of learnig** [1]. It contains minor tasks done for academic courses at the Faculty of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
Year 2020/21 was my first year of intensive programming, although I had some expirience with *Java* and *C++* before.

Majority of them is done correctly, so they can be treated as a prompt when working on the same exercises.

#### Explanation
[1] Mess which is strongly visible in the directories `pakiety_matematyczne` and `programowanie1` is keeped on purpose. These are some of the files which I worked on when I was learning. I belive that this structure depicts my development even better. On the other hand, the code in `programowanie2` folder (created later) is documented and comperhensible even without the context.
